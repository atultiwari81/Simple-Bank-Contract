# Simple Bank (with Deposits and Withdrawals)

## Project Description
Simple Bank is a minimalistic decentralized banking smart contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether securely. It keeps individual balances for each user and ensures only users can access their funds.

## Project Vision
The project envisions an on-chain banking alternative that is secure, transparent, and fully decentralized. It serves as a foundational step toward building more advanced DeFi banking products in the future.

## Key Features
- **User Balances:** Each userâ€™s Ether is securely tracked in the contract.
- **Secure Withdrawals:** Only the account owner can withdraw their funds.
- **Bank Closure:** The contract owner can close the bank and retrieve remaining funds.
- **Event Logging:** All key actions emit events for easy tracking.

## Future Scope
- Add interest calculation based on deposit duration.
- Introduce multi-token (ERC20) support.
- Implement daily withdrawal limits.
- Build a user-friendly frontend with account overviews.
